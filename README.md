# infinite-scroll
Using Unsplash API to display images without any loading experience 

In order to achieve it, I requested an API key from [Unsplash's developer](https://unsplash.com/developers) page which allowed me to load their images. 
JavaScript functionality was focused on loading small number of images as soon as the scroll bar would reach a particular height.
